<h2>CHAPTER III — Beyond the Factory Gate</h2>
<p>They had all once had homes. Real homes, with earth beneath their fingernails and the smell of old linen lingering in the rooms. But what they had left behind no longer existed — not in any way that could bring them back.</p>
<p>Marko had come from the hinterland, from a small town that had lived off its mine, until the mine itself was shut down. He had a son, taken from him by court order after the divorce. To pay alimony, he had taken a job at the generator factory. It was meant to be temporary, yet the years passed, and Marko was still here — counting days, breathing in fumes, and dreaming of an embrace that had once been his, but no longer.</p>
<p>Jelena was from the city — once a law student, she had fled a system that demanded she either sell herself or break. She had no family, only a sick mother, now long gone. The factory had been both her escape and her sentence. They called it “survival,” but she knew it was merely another name for dying in installments.</p>
<p>Marko and Jelena had found each other among broken machines and broken people. Their bond was neither loud nor romantic. It was an alliance between two shattered souls holding on so they wouldn’t fall. In the pauses between shifts, they exchanged glances, a sentence or two. At night, when the factory sank into darkness, she would sit beside him by the dumpster, and they would share the remains of dinner. There was something warm in that. Something real. Something human.</p>
<p>Dragan… Dragan was another story. They said he had once been a physics teacher. His eyes looked through things, as if seeing the inner workings beneath. He rarely spoke, but when he did, it sounded like it came from another world.</p>
<p>He had no family. Or maybe he had, but had forgotten. Or lost them. No one knew. No one dared to ask.</p>
<p>In his spare time, he read newspapers a decade old, searching for patterns. He recorded the hall temperatures, the timing of breakdowns, the changes in the color of smoke. Some laughed at him, but when the fire broke out, he was the only one who turned toward the wind. He was the first to notice that the smoke behaved strangely.</p>
<p>The next day, the workers began to cough. Not an ordinary cough, but the deep, dry kind that tears at your throat and leaves flecks of blood on handkerchiefs. Rashes appeared. Red spots on the arms; some noticed changes in their skin. Dragan knew — there had been something more than plastic in that fire.</p>
<p>He told no one officially. He simply wrote it in his notebook:</p>
<blockquote>Contamination possible. Act if the number of symptoms exceeds 25% in Group A.</blockquote>
<hr/>
<hr/>
<p>The shift supervisor, Ilija, was a man who never worked but always commanded. He had the posture of a petty tyrant — short, balding, with a stomach that gave him false confidence. He reveled in power because he knew he was powerless outside these walls. Here, he was God. Force. Judgment.</p>
<p>He liked to arrive late to the start of the shift, just so everyone would have to stand still while he passed. If he saw someone talking while the line was running, he would approach from behind and slam a folder onto the table. Once, he knocked Marko’s tool into an oil tray. He made Jelena move boxes three times over, just because he didn’t like her “tone of voice.”</p>
<p>And Dragan… he ignored him. He didn’t know what to do with him. Perhaps he feared him.</p>
<p>When the first workers began vomiting in the hall, Ilija said:</p>
<blockquote>That’s from stress. You’re taking too many breaks — that’s the problem. Starting tomorrow, breaks will be cut to 12 minutes.</blockquote>
<hr/>
<hr/>
<p>Soon, everyone wore masks — not because they were given any, but because they had sewn them from old T-shirts. No one from management came to check the situation. They called it “temporary conditions.”</p>
<p>Dragan had a theory:</p>
<blockquote>The fire burned through containers of chemical waste. They left them here because proper disposal is expensive. Now… we breathe it in.</blockquote>

<h2>CHAPTER XII — Those Who Disappear</h2>
<p>Dragan sat in the canteen, staring into the tea that had long since gone cold. He was alone, but his eyes were fixed on the screen above the coffee machine. The cameras were working again — tracking movement speed, measuring efficiency, scanning faces. Everything as before. And yet, something had changed.</p>
<p>Nenad.</p>
<p>His name had not only vanished from the system — it had disappeared from speech as well. People avoided mentioning him, as if his existence was a shame. Or a danger. Only Marko and Jelena still whispered his name, and only when they were sure no one could hear.</p>
<p>Dragan knew this pattern. Ten years earlier, in the “Metalcom” factory near Valjevo, the same quietly orchestrated disappearance had occurred — a young man named Goran, “temporarily transferred” to another sector. Months later, someone had found his crushed helmet in the scrapyard. Officially — an accident. Unofficially — a story no one dared to tell again.</p>
<p><em>Silence kills more than noise,</em> Dragan thought.</p>
<p>This factory, modern as it was, was the same machine. A great vacuum of the system. Once you slipped into its crack, you never returned.</p>
<p>That day, Dragan decided to attempt the unthinkable — to access the reserve server system an older worker had once mentioned in passing. The man was Gavra, once an electrician, now just a cleaner in the technical sector. One of those demoted without a word.</p>
<p>He found him in the basement of Hall C.</p>
<p>— “Gavra, remember when you told me there was a backup system?”</p>
<p>The old man flinched, looked around, and lowered his mop.</p>
<p>— “Why do you care?”</p>
<p>— “Nenad. I want to know.”</p>
<p>Gavra was silent for a moment, then spoke in a low voice:</p>
<p>— “You’ve got ten minutes. Follow me.”</p>
<p>Entering the old server room was like stepping back in time. The terminals were old but still functional. Gavra entered a password. The screen lit up with images — workers’ current locations, old notes, card swipes, entries and exits.</p>
<p>Dragan found Nenad’s name. Last log: Hall 4, position B-13, time 03:38. And then — nothing. No camera recorded his exit. His card was never registered leaving the hall.</p>
<p>— “So he’s still here?”</p>
<p>Gavra shook his head.</p>
<p>— “No. If the system never logged him leaving, then he didn’t leave. But someone later came in — and erased the trace.”</p>
<p>Dragan stared at the screen. He wasn’t afraid. He was angry.</p>
<p>Later that evening, when he returned to his room, he found a note taped to his locker.</p>
<p><em>If you know about Nenad — keep quiet. Your family isn’t in the factory.</em></p>
<p>His hand trembled.</p>
<p>In the corner of the room, Marko was asleep, exhausted. Jelena wasn’t there. And the silence — that same heavy silence from that night — fell again.</p>
