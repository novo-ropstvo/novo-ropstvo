            <h2>CHAPTER III — Beyond the Factory Gate</h2>
            <p>They all once had homes. Real homes, with dirt under their fingernails and the scent of old blankets. But what they left behind no longer existed — not in a way that could bring them back.</p>
            <p>Marko came from a mining town that died the day the mine closed. He had a son he no longer saw. The alimony kept him chained. The generator factory was supposed to be a temporary job. But time passed. He stayed. Breathing smoke. Dreaming of an embrace he'd once had — and lost.</p>
            <p>Jelena used to study law. She ran from a system that wanted to break her. Her mother, long gone. No family left. The factory became both her refuge and her sentence.</p>
            <p>They found each other among broken machines and broken people. It wasn't love. It was survival. They shared silence, scraps of lunch, glances that meant “we're still human.”</p>

            <h2>CHAPTER XII — Those Who Disappear</h2>
            <p>Dragan sat in the canteen, expressionless. They said he had once been a physics professor. He spoke little, but his eyes saw through everything.</p>
            <p>When the fire broke out, he noticed something was wrong with the smoke. Thick. Chemical. The next day, coughing. Blood. Rashes.</p>
            <p>He didn’t panic. He made notes:</p>
            <blockquote>“Chemical exposure likely. Group A — monitor. If symptoms cross 25%, activate protocol.”</blockquote>
            <p>Management stayed silent. They always did. Ilija, the shift supervisor, shortened breaks:</p>
            <blockquote>“Too much sitting. From now on — 12 minutes.”</blockquote>
            <p>No masks. No protection. They called it “temporary.”</p>
            <p>People made their own masks from cloth and hope. Dragan calculated the exposure dose. And waited.</p>
            <p>Then Nenad disappeared.</p>
            <p>His locker was emptied. His name erased from records. Like others before him.</p>
            <p>That evening, Dragan found a note stuck in his locker:</p>
            <blockquote>If you know about Nenad — stay silent. Your family isn't in the factory.</blockquote>
            <p>He burned it immediately. But he knew — silence is a weapon. And resistance, a necessity.</p>
            <p>And it will come.</p>
